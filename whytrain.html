                    <h1>Why Train?</h1>
                    <p>Every athlete has a competitive drive that pushes them to new heights and limits. What many athletes don't have is the proper training program to set them apart from the crowd so they can make it to the next level. A vast majority of athletes play competitive sports up until college but never make it to the next level, on college scholarships or as walk-ons, because they don't have a comprehensive sports performance training program to prepare them for the competition. In collegiate sports, performance training programs are now considered an integral part of athlete preparation and are now being implemented into sports programs by most colleges.</p>
                    <p>Sports performance training is designed to improve fitness levels for the purpose of improving the ability to perform in a sport, no matter the sport. Strength training, conditioning, sport-specific techniques and drills, and consistent accountability and monitoring by a qualified trainer are all key components to the foundation of a performance training program for each athlete to improve performance and gain an edge.</p>
                    <p>Here are 5 reasons why you should be utilizing Alex as a sports performance coach:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>RECIEVE A SPORT-SPECIFIC PROGRAM</h3>

                        <li>
                            <h3>PERFORMANCE TRAINING PRODUCES THE RIGHT RESULTS</h3>
                            <p>It’s not enough to provide results… serious athletes need the right results. Each athlete has different training needs specific to their position and sport. Alex provides performance training programs that are designed for each athlete’s specific needs.</p>
                        </li>

                            <h3>POSITIVE RESULTS START IMMEDIATELY</h3>
                            <p>Alex knows that serious athletes don’t have months or even weeks to wait for performance improvements. Athletes need results now to meet the demands of the competition. With Alex as your trainer, you will begin to see (and feel) positive results from your first session.</p>
